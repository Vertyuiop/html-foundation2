        <h2>Start up with Web Development</h2>
        <p>Posted by <strong>Vert Ryan Sanchez</strong></p>

        <h3>What is Web Development?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Web development</strong> is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves everything from web design to programming and database management. Web development is generally divided into three core areas: <strong>Frontend Development, Backend Development,</strong> and <strong>Full Stack Development.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
        <p>
           <strong>Frontend development</strong> refers to everything that users see and interact with on the website. It involves the design, structure, and layout of the website and is often referred to as the ‘client side’ of an application.
        </p>

        <h4>Frontend Technologies:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages, defining their structure and layout.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Frontend Frameworks/Libraries:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>React.js:</strong> A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Angular:</strong> A full-fledged framework for building single-page applications (SPAs), with features like two-way data binding and dependency injection.</li>
            <li><strong>Vue.js:</strong> A progressive JavaScript framework that is flexible and can be used for building both simple and complex user interfaces.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Backend Development</h3>
            <p>
               <strong>Backend development</strong> refers to the server side of a website, where the logic and data are processed and stored. Users do not directly interact with this part, but it ensures that the website works properly.
            </p>

        <h3>Server-side Programming Languages and Frameworks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PHP:</strong> PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.</li>
            <li><strong>Java:</strong> Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. It is highly scalable.</li>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. </li>
            <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Ruby:</strong> Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.</li>
            <li><strong>C#:</strong> C# is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft.</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Full Stack Development</h3>
            <p>
               <strong>Full-stack development</strong> refers to the practice of developing both the frontend and backend of a website or web application. Full-stack developers have a deep understanding of both areas and can build end-to-end solutions.
            </p>

            <h4>Full Stack Technologies:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MERN Stack:</strong> MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js</li>
                <li><strong>MEAN Stack:</strong> MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js</li>
                <li><strong>JAMstack:</strong> JavaScript, APIs, Markup</li>
                <li><strong>Django Stack:</strong> Django, MySQL/PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
                <li><strong>Spring Boot Stack:</strong> Spring Boot, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Java</li>
                <li><strong>LAMP Stack:</strong> Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP</li>
                <li><strong>LEMP Stack:</strong> Linux, Engine-X, MySQL, PHP</li>
            </ul>
